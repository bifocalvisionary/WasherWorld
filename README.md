### Introduction
In our household groupchat, almost 20% of all messages sent in a week are asking about the status of the washing machine. This is a problem we believed we could solve using Twilio and a simple Flask app. This is a framework that can be built off of and adapted to many different laundry rooms. 

For this BrickHack, we decided to make a useful web app for students at RIT. Using CockroachDB, Flask, Jinja, Python, Digital Ocean Droplet, and Twilio we created a
website that allows students to check the availablility, quality, and the status of washing machines at dorms.

It also allows students to use a text message system to automatically alert them of when their clothes are ready, as well as updating the app for other students.

### Built Using
The databases are managed with cockroachDB, the frontend of the app is html and bootstrap an the backend uses flask. Email and phone functionality is proivided through twilio.

### Future Plans
A great improvement to this project would be a hardware attatchment that would allow for automated monitoring of machines. Because of the ease of opt-in that was used in our design philosophy, if you're interested in seeing this at your school, apartment, or home, then the contents of this repo are a good start.
