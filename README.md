### Introduction
For this BrickHack, we decided to make a useful web app for students at RIT. Using CockroachDB, Flask, Jinja, Python, Digital Ocean Droplet, and Twilio we created a
website that allows students to check the availablility, quality, and the status of washing machines at dorms.

It also allows students to use a text message system to automatically alert them of when their clothes are ready, as well as updating the app for other students.
